# v-modal-backdrop

> A generic backdrop component for vue

## Installation

With NPM:

`npm install v-modal-backdrop`

With Yarn:

`yarn add v-modal-backdrop`

With a script tag:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/v-modal-backdrop@1.0.0/dist/modal-backdrop.js"></script>
```

Then you have to include basic style for the modal in your html (or write your own):

```css
.modal {
  z-index: 1050;
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  outline: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
}

.modal-backdrop {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  background-color: #000;
  opacity: 0;
  transition: all 0.15s;
}
.modal-backdrop.modal-opened {
  opacity: 0.4;
}
```

## Usage

Call `Vue.use` to install the ModalBackdrop plugin (it will add a `v-modal-backdrop` component globally) or use it directly.

Then:

```html
<!-- When someProperty is truthy, the modal will be appended at the end of the body tag (customizable), otherwise the modal will not appear in the DOM -->
<v-modal-backdrop v-model="someProperty">
  <!-- Slot contents here -->
</v-modal-backdrop>
```

### Programmatically

```js
const modal = window.ModalBackdrop.show({
  // props you want to pass to the modal here.
  // (`parent:this` === the current context)
}, ...children)
// `children` is an array of slots. Each slot is either a string or a VNode (see this.$createElement at https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#render)

// Later
modal.hide()
```

## Component props

```js
{
  clickOnBackdrop: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: true // if true, modal is closed when backdrop is clicked
  },
  transition: {
    type: String,
    default: '' // transition name for modal content
  },
  transitionDuration: {
    type: Number,
    default: 150
  },
  escKey: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: true // if true, hitting esc key closes the modal
  },
  beforeClose: {type: Function, default: ()=>{}}, // you can return false to prevent modal from closing
  zOffset: {
    type: Number,
    default: 20 // z-index offset between each nested modal
  },
  mdlClass: {type: String, default: ''},
  mdlContentClass: {type: String, default: ''},
  mdlBackdropClass: {type: String, default: ''},
  embedElement: {
    type: null,
    default: 'body' // String or HTMLElement
  }
}
```
